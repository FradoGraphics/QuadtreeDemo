Troubleshooting Guide for building or running the project:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
	Your OpenGL windows driver doesn't support version 3.2. 

Solution:
	Try to update your graphics card drivers.
	
	Alternatively perform the following steps to use Mesa software rendering:

	1.	Copy the file "opengl32.dll" from the MesaGL subfolder to the folder 
		where the file "QuadtreeDemo.exe" is located.
	2.	Restart the demo.
	
Problem:
	An error message appears saying that GUI controls could not be initialized. 
	Or some controls don't respond when clicking on them.

Solution:
 	Rebuild the project so that the manifest file responsible for using the correct
	version of the controls gets embedded into the binary file. The file is located here:	
	\manifests\CommonControls.manifest

 	Ensure that the file comctl32.dll is on your computer and has at least version 6.
	The file is part of the operating system and gets distributed by MS beginning with 
	Windows XP SP3.

Problem:
	Fonts look blurred when larger fonts and higher dpi settings have been selected
	in the display settings of the operating system.
	
Solution:
	Rebuild the project so that the manifest file responsible for activating high dpi 
	awareness gets embedded into the binary file. The file is located here:
	\manifests\DPIaware.manifest
